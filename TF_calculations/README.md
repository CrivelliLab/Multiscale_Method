## Calculation for Thermodynamics Force to blance the density profile in the AdResS system.

Simple tools to generate Thermodyanamic force for the AdResS method.

All necessary scripts to generate the potentials are in ./scripts directory. Since all necessary tools are written in Python, you can call these codes from ESPResSo++ program.


Also, here we have included an example to build one site water CG potentials. 

To run the example,
cd ./example
chmod +x water_TF.sh
./water_CG.sh water.pdb water.xtc
