## Computational Tools for Adaptive Resolution Molecular Dynamics Simulation 

Here, the atomistic trajectories are analyized to build:
- Coarse Grained particle based on the center of mass of the system.
		o CG_1B_Steps: Tools to generate a 1-Bead Coarse-Grained potentials from Radical distribution function.
					- including an example to apply this method to Water molecueles.
		o CG_IE_Steps: Tools to generate Coarse-Grained potentials from intermolecular interaction energy.
					- including an example to apply this method to Water molecueles.
					
- To calculate the Thermodyanmic force for AdResS method,
