## Computational Tools for Adaptive Resolution Molecular Dynamics Simulation 

Here, the atomistic trajectories are analyized to build:
- Coarse Grained particle based on the center of mass of the system.

		o CG_1B_Steps: An 1-Bead Coarse-Grained potentials from Radial distribution function.
					- including an example to apply this method to Water molecueles.

		o CG_IE_Steps: Coarse-Grained potentials from intermolecular interactions.
					- including an example to apply this method to Water molecueles.
					
- To calculate the Thermodyanmic force for AdResS method,
